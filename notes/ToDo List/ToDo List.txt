KISS - KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID
YAGNI - YOU AREN'T GONNA NEED IT


Short-Term TODO:


- Create additional AI
	- Ranged AI
	- Need to research interesting AI mechanics that can fit well
- Create more types of rooms

- Room Generation
	-
- Put player indicator on minimap
	- Minimap needs to be able to be forced to update
	- Minimap grid needs to be fixed, it's slightly off
	- Draw a small sprite to indicate player

- Hide rooms outside current room (shader or surface?)

- Touching a square in a room without enemies should allow player to move there

- Player Mechanics
	- Player has 3 slots for cards (at bottom of screen)
		- Each card can do something and has an active effect
		- Relics that have passive effects



	
- Create Turn State Machine
	- Starting Player Turn
		- Calculate available player paths
	- Player Turn
		- Wait for player to execute move
	- Player Moving
		- Attack depending on rules
		- Open chest and grab loot (present to player)
		- Grab loot on tile
	- Ending Player Turn
		- Execute trapped tiles
		- Execute any status effects (poison, burning)
	- Starting Enemy Turn
	- Enemy Turn
	- Ending Enemy Turn
	
- Enemy AI
	- AI should be created to assign to a class with rules
	- Kind of like how AI classes can be assigned in Minecraft
	
- Player Classes
	- Warrior/Knight
		- Can melee when starting and moving next to, or 
	
	- Ranger/Archer
		- Has a jump
		- Ranged attack
		- Can only melee when attacking directly
	
	- Mage/Wizard
	
	
- Enemy Mechanics
	- Blind enemy that attacks vibrations/movement (Minecraft Warden)
	- Strong enemy that tries to push player?
	- Enemy that attacks in a wide area (like a diamond wave across entire map)

Notes:
- Game feels unresponsive as player can touch but not receive action while it's cycling through other states and there are no enemies


Done, but don't want to erase
- Create a touch system
 - Touch system needs to account for what is active
	- Grid touch system must require player to touch and release on same grid tile.  The touch
		must be cancelled if player drags finger off the grid tile.  (This may need tweaking
		to not be too sensitive, like maybe half a tile around could be dragged to).
	- Player should be able to touch the player object and see valid moves and attacks
	- Touch a valid move square should move immediately
	- Touch a valid attack square should attack immediately
	- Touching an invalid square should provide feedback to the player or do nothing
