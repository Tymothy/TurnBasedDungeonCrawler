Notes for near-future Tym:
Working on implementing TrueState system for a game state and to be able to handle player states

- Create a touch system
 - Touch system needs to account for what is active
	- Grid touch system must require player to touch and release on same grid tile.  The touch
		must be cancelled if player drags finger off the grid tile.  (This may need tweaking
		to not be too sensitive, like maybe half a tile around could be dragged to).
	- Player should be able to touch the player object and see valid moves and attacks
	- Touch a valid move square should move immediately
	- Touch a valid attack square should attack immediately
	- Touching an invalid square should provide feedback to the player or do nothing
	
- Create Turn State Machine
	- Starting Player Turn
		- Calculate available player paths
	- Player Turn
		- Wait for player to execute move
	- Player Moving
		- Attack depending on rules
		- Open chest and grab loot (present to player)
		- Grab loot on tile
	- Ending Player Turn
		- Execute trapped tiles
		- Execute any status effects (poison, burning)
	- Starting Enemy Turn
	- Enemy Turn
	- Ending Enemy Turn
	
- Enemy AI
	- AI should be created to assign to a class with rules
	- Kind of like how AI classes can be assigned in Minecraft
