Notes for near-future Tym:
Working on multi touch system and integrating it to be able to check GUI layer first,
then room layer for touch collision.  Whenever screen is touched, grab the grid coord regardless,
even if it's behind the button.

- Create a touch system
 - Touch system needs to account for what is active
	- Grid touch system must require player to touch and release on same grid tile.  The touch
		must be cancelled if player drags finger off the grid tile.  (This may need tweaking
		to not be too sensitive, like maybe half a tile around could be dragged to).
	- Player should be able to touch the player object and see valid moves and attacks
	- Touch a valid move square should move immediately
	- Touch a valid attack square should attack immediately
	- Touching an invalid square should provide feedback to the player or do nothing
