Bosses could be boring if the fight is the same every time.  Bosses should not be fully solvable.  Give bosses special abilities to account for this

List of possible abilities

- Spawning minions
	Description:
		Spawn minions around the boss

	Pros:
		Introduces a lot of uncertainity
	 
	Cons:
		Could become overwhelming fast
		Not really "new" combat
		
	Notes:
		Should probably be done only a limited number of times.
		Could be done to give a time element to a boss.  The longer it takes to defeat, the more minions are created
		The new AI would need to be added to turn order
		
- Ranged attacks
	Description: Sent a wave of attacks across the room
	
	Pros:
		Allows fair ranged attacks that could trap the player into difficult decisions
	
	Cons:
		
	
	Notes:
		Should have a pattern to be a bit predictable
		Each tile that will be under "attack" should be marked at least one turn prior
	
	
- Moveable Fire Lines
	Description: A line of fire, or other damaging material, is set along a path and stays for multiple turns
	
	Pros:
		Restricts movement
		Could force player to use resources to avoid and play around
		
	Cons: 
		
	
	Notes:	
		Lines should stay for multiple turns, but not forever.  Maybe having a 3 on 3 off would be good
		AI would need to learn to account for "Dangerous" tiles to not walk into danger
		
- Large Melee Attack

	Pros:
