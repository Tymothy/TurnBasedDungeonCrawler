Design Rules
	One click, one action.  Allow use of modifiers, such as clicking to select a fireball and casting the fireball on same turn

Types of AI Mechanics
	Basic
		Seek player and attack using direct
		Seek player and damage every turn with aoe(like a flame around it)
		Leave trail of damaging liquid
		Throw damaging liquid that stays for a turn
		Creature explodes and does extra damage (Maybe stands still to allow character a turn to get away?)
		Liquid that does not allow turn to end on (will set targ grid to one further kinda like doors)
		Charges at target when meeting certain rules (like within a range)
		Has after death regen (mummy in Stardew)
		Shoots an X or + pattern every X turns
		
		
		
	
	Advanced
		Summoning
		

MECHANIC
	Click and drag to fire a projectile (Like retrobowl) Implemented with c_shooter, but removed as it doesn't fit theme.  At least for now.
		
		

Possible player abilities
	Ignore first hit per floor
	
	
Types of Attacks
	Melee
		Direct
			Start turn near target, no move and attack target directly
	
		Slide
			Start turn near target, move a tile and end move near target.
		
		Shield
			Protect against attacks coming from direction the opponent is facing (Front 3 squares?, would require AI to be smart enough to try to target behind the player.  Might need a cooldown on use)
			
		
		
	Ranged
		Line
			Target shoots along a cone the way they are facing
			
	Spells
		TBD
